---

[The Big Give](https://donate.thebiggive.org.uk/) is an innovative organisation specialising in bringing charities, philanthropists and the public together to multiply their impact. Over the years, The Big Give has raised over &pound;190m for thousands of great causes through the power of match funding by organising various campaigns during the year. Double the donation &mldr; Double the Impact.

One of their annual campaigns is the [Champions for Children](https://donate.thebiggive.org.uk/champions-for-children-2022) Campaign which is now taking place in June 2022. This campaign is launched by [The Childhood Trust](https://www.childhoodtrust.org.uk/): the London&apos;s child poverty charity dedicated to alleviating the impact of poverty on children and young people living in the capital. (Did you know? 55% of poor children in London are materially deprived compared to 44% in the rest of England?)

Through the Champions for Children Campaign this year, The Childhood Trust is offering &pound;3.5 million of unrestricted funding in the form to match funding the donations of the participating charities.

## How Charizone supported the Champions for Children Campaign: 

It was a huge privilege for us when we were asked to support the campaign by providing the data and analysis of the charities involved in the campaign and thus to humbly contribute towards of the vision of alleviating poverty for children in London.  

Our charity reports were an aid to both The Big Give and The Childhood Trust in their due diligence processes. The reports included the evidence, analysis and assessment of charities according to our framework and data-driven processes aimed at shedding light at the charities work as well as porviding a base to promote engagement and constructive dialogues with each charity. It is worth noting that our reports did not cover all the charities involved in this campaign as our database focuses on charities with income of over &pound;500k over the last 3 years due to the availability of some of the data points we collect at scale. Whereas the applications were open for charities that have an annual income of over &pound;25,000 and at least one set of filed accounts.

The Big Give is aware of the success of their platform in multiplying the amount donated to charities every year. With such responsibility; it is important that they  know that the charities they are selecting and promoting are operating in the best possible ways to achieve their charitable mission. With our reports, there were able to verify the information, identify areas of potential issues and avoid supporting charities that do not align with their values.  

This is what they said about us:

        <p>&quot;Working with Charizone has helped augment our due diligence checks on charities to ensure our philanthropic partners have the complete picture of charities to make informed funding decisions. The team at Charizone has been very helpful in delivering the data we need in their bespoke reports and giving us a detailed overview across all of the key areas of the charities work and financial considerations. Charizone brings more transparency to the charity sector and we would recommend them to funders and donors alike to better understand the organisations they are supporting.&quot;</p>

Similarly, The Childhood Trust has committed the time and resources to diligently understand the new charities joining the campaign and to build on the existing relationships they charities they have supported in the past; their processes are detailed and comprehensive. Our reports do the hard work of digging the data from multiple sources and presenting them in a clear and consistent narrative saving a huge amount of time and effort. In addition, our data-driven quality-controlled processes are scalable and reduce the subjectivity and bias involved in the analysis. 

We are enormously encouraged to be part of the community of the informed and responible funders and thrilled to share our success story with you.
