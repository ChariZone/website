Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the lawful bases we rely on for processing this information are:

## How we use cookies

"Cookies" are pieces of data created by web sites that store information in your web browser.

The only cookies we use are those that support the essential functions of our site and our tools, such as allowing users to log in.

To get critical information about the behavior of our visitors, we use [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com). This analytics software gives us insight about our visitors only in general, but not about individuals per say, as it does not track visitors and does not store any personal identifiable information.

Because Simple Analytics does not use cookies or similar technology to identify or track you, there is no reason to request your consent. [Go to their documentation](https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/what-we-collect) to find out what Simple Analytics collects (and most importantly what they don't).

- Your right of **access** - You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information.

You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you.
